        <h2 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background"></a>Background</h2><blockquote>
<p>Last year, I participated in a science and innovation competition at school. Under the guidance of my mentor, I worked on a drone project and became deeply involved in it. Through this project, I learned knowledge and skills related to control, mechanics, circuits, signal processing, motor driving, and sensor data transmission. My hands-on abilities improved significantly, and I developed a strong interest in creating technological works. The greatest sense of achievement came from seeing a device I designed, built, and debugged actually operate and perform tasks. Although the quadcopter project did not qualify in that competition, my mother reminded me that I had been practicing swimming since childhood and participated in many swimming competitions. Based on that background, she suggested that I could conduct an engineering research project combining swimming and technology. That idea excited me greatly, so I began research, design, and experiments related to it last year. I will record my experiences from the past year one by one in this blog.</p>

<h2 id="Motivation-How-to-Improve-My-Swimming-Performance"><a href="#Motivation-How-to-Improve-My-Swimming-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Motivation: How to Improve My Swimming Performance"></a>Motivation: How to Improve My Swimming Performance</h2><blockquote>
<p>The purpose of doing research around my swimming training and competitions is, of course, to improve my swimming performance.<br>During daily training, my coach often emphasizes key points of swimming technique. How could I quickly summarize these technical essentials? I asked an AI: To improve my performance, I must first understand what affects it. The AI gave me the following answer.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Three-Core-Factors-for-Improving-Swimming-Performance"><a href="#Three-Core-Factors-for-Improving-Swimming-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Three Core Factors for Improving Swimming Performance"></a>Three Core Factors for Improving Swimming Performance</h2><blockquote>
<p>The AI summarized it as follows:<br>Improving swimming performance is a systematic process that can be attributed to three core elements: <strong>biomechanics (technique)</strong>, <strong>physiology (physical ability)</strong>, and <strong>psychology (mental strength)</strong>. Among them, biomechanics (technique) is the most complex, delicate, and also the most suitable part to be analyzed and optimized using engineering methods.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="1-Biomechanics-The-“Technical-Soul”-of-Swimming"><a href="#1-Biomechanics-The-“Technical-Soul”-of-Swimming" class="headerlink" title="1. Biomechanics: The “Technical Soul” of Swimming"></a>1. Biomechanics: The “Technical Soul” of Swimming</h3><p>This part focuses on how to make the <strong>human body as a “biological machine”</strong> move through the water with maximum efficiency and minimal resistance.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Reducing Resistance – “Becoming Streamlined”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Streamlined body position</strong>: The foundation of all technique. The key is to keep the body as straight as possible at all times to minimize the frontal area. This includes:<ul>
<li><strong>Core stability</strong>: If your midsection (waist and abdomen) is unstable, it’s like a soft rope — no matter how hard your limbs work, power is wasted and body wobble increases drag.</li>
<li><strong>Head position</strong>: Eyes should look toward the bottom of the pool, keeping the spine aligned, as if a string is pulling your head forward.</li>
<li><strong>Body rotation</strong>: Especially in freestyle and backstroke, moderate rotation around the spine reduces shoulder entry resistance and better engages core strength.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Increasing Propulsion – “Pulling Efficiently”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High-elbow catch</strong>: The core source of propulsion. You don’t push water with your palms; instead, you “anchor” your arms and hands in the water and pull your body past that fixed point using your torso and shoulders. <strong>Early vertical forearm</strong> is the key to achieving a high-elbow catch.</li>
<li><strong>Power sequence and core activation</strong>: The pulling motion should not rely solely on the arms. The correct order is “core initiates → transfers to shoulders → then to arms,” like a whip motion. Your core muscles are the engine, while the arms are just the drive shafts.</li>
<li><strong>Surface area and feel for water</strong>: You should use not just your palms but also your forearms as a single surface during the catch phase — this is known as “feel for the water.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Rhythm and Timing – “Making Movements Harmonious”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Breathing timing</strong>: Breathing is the only movement that disrupts the streamlined body position and rhythm. It must be completed quickly and lightly during the trough of body rotation to minimize interference.</li>
<li><strong>Coordination of arms and legs</strong>: The main role of kicking is to balance the body, lift the lower limbs, provide partial propulsion, and assist the core. The rhythm of the kick must be precisely synchronized with the stroke.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-Physiology-The-“Energy-Engine”-of-Swimming"><a href="#2-Physiology-The-“Energy-Engine”-of-Swimming" class="headerlink" title="2. Physiology: The “Energy Engine” of Swimming"></a>2. Physiology: The “Energy Engine” of Swimming</h3><p>Without physical conditioning, even the best technique is meaningless.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Aerobic capacity</strong>: The foundation for long-distance events, determining sustained power output and recovery speed.  </li>
<li><strong>Anaerobic capacity</strong>: Determines sprint ability and acceleration after starts and turns.  </li>
<li><strong>Strength and flexibility</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>Dryland strength</strong>: Especially core, back (main pulling muscles), and shoulder strength.</li>
<li><strong>In-water strength</strong>: Specific strength for generating force in a water environment.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Excellent shoulder and ankle flexibility (particularly plantar flexion) directly increase stroke length and kick efficiency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="3-Psychology-The-“Commander”-of-Swimming"><a href="#3-Psychology-The-“Commander”-of-Swimming" class="headerlink" title="3. Psychology: The “Commander” of Swimming"></a>3. Psychology: The “Commander” of Swimming</h3><ol>
<li><strong>Feel for water</strong>: An intuition of how water flows and how to “grip” it — developed through thousands of strokes.  </li>
<li><strong>Rhythm and focus</strong>: Maintaining form under fatigue, focusing on personal rhythm and tactics without being disturbed by competitors.  </li>
<li><strong>Tactical intelligence</strong>: Includes energy distribution, start and turn precision, and situational awareness during races.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="How-Can-These-Elements-Be-Combined-with-My-Engineering-Project-—-Entry-Points-from-Engineering-Perspective"><a href="#How-Can-These-Elements-Be-Combined-with-My-Engineering-Project-—-Entry-Points-from-Engineering-Perspective" class="headerlink" title="How Can These Elements Be Combined with My Engineering Project? — Entry Points from Engineering Perspective"></a>How Can These Elements Be Combined with My Engineering Project? — Entry Points from Engineering Perspective</h2><blockquote>
<p>After learning the three key elements of swimming performance, I wanted to find a feasible research topic. Since I still lack a lot of professional engineering knowledge, I hope the research goal can be small and achievable. Here are the AI’s suggestions:<br><strong>Use engineering tools to quantify, analyze, and optimize the above biomechanical elements.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>For “Reducing Resistance”</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Engineering research</strong>: You can design an <strong>underwater video analysis system</strong> (using waterproof sports cameras) combined with computer vision algorithms to automatically identify and quantify body posture angles (e.g., hip drop angle, head tilt) and compute cross-sectional area changes — much more precise than a coach’s visual observation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>For “Increasing Propulsion”</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Engineering research</strong>: You could develop a <strong>wearable sensor system</strong> (IMUs placed on wrists, elbows, and shoulders) to measure <strong>high-elbow angles, stroke path stability, and stroke frequency</strong>. You might also build a simple <strong>hand pressure sensor</strong> to quantify “feel for water,” i.e., how much force the swimmer applies during the catch phase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>For “Rhythm and Timing”</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Engineering research</strong>: Using the same IMU or video analysis, you could <strong>automatically calculate stroke cycle duration, breathing side rotation angle, and kick-stroke synchronization</strong>, generating visualized data reports.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In summary:</strong><br>Your unique advantage is that you not only <em>know</em> these key elements — you have <em>felt</em> them with your body. Now your task is to use engineering technology to translate those “feelings” into “data,” turning the coach’s “experience” into “scientific evidence.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After reviewing these suggestions, I realized that the “rhythm and timing” category might be the easiest to implement. It reminds me of PWM waveforms in motor control — alternating between high and low states. I could use similar methods to find such cycles. And indeed, swimming rhythm is crucial. From this, I found my research direction.</p>

<h2 id="3-Learning-Process-and-Methods-How-I-Studied"><a href="#3-Learning-Process-and-Methods-How-I-Studied" class="headerlink" title="3. Learning Process and Methods: How I Studied"></a><strong>3. Learning Process and Methods: How I Studied</strong></h2><p>My learning process followed a gradual and practical approach — combining theory with hands-on exercises.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Setting a Learning Plan:</strong><br>I started with the <strong>“Python”</strong> micro-course, then moved on to <strong>“Pandas”</strong>, which focuses on data processing, and later explored other topics like <strong>“Data Visualization.”</strong><br>I studied according to the time suggestions provided in each module, sometimes spending extra time when needed, especially at the beginning. Later, I tried to stick closely to the recommended time to maintain consistency.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Immersive Learning and Practice:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Following the lessons carefully:</strong><br>I read each tutorial carefully and made sure to understand the examples and concepts.</li>
<li><strong>Completing every exercise:</strong><br>I solved all the practice problems independently. When errors appeared, I analyzed the error messages, reviewed the lessons, or sought help from AI tools or online searches. This process deepened my understanding.</li>
<li><strong>Using Kaggle’s kernels and community:</strong><br>The auto-complete and notebook features were very helpful. I often tried alternative coding methods to strengthen my knowledge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Time Investment:</strong><br>I spent about <strong>20–25 hours</strong> completing the “Python” and “Pandas” courses over three weeks, studying 1–1.5 hours daily. This routine helped me stay consistent and focused.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Most Important:</strong><br>Typing code manually and debugging is crucial. Coding is like playing the piano—the more you practice, the stronger your muscle memory becomes. Continuous hands-on coding helped me build confidence and fluency in Python.</p>
